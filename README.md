# North Temperate Lakes LTER: Fish Lengths and Weights 1981 - current

This data package contains fish length and weight data collected as part of the North Temperate Lakes Long-Term Ecological Research (NTL LTER) project. The data span from 1981 to the present and provide valuable information on fish assemblages in eleven primary lakes, including Allequash, Big Muskellunge, Crystal, Sparkling, Trout, bog lakes, and Trout Bog, Mendota, Monona, Wingra, and Fish.

## General Information

-   Data Package: knb-lter-ntl.6.34
-   Local Identifier: knb-lter-ntl.6.34
-   Title: North Temperate Lakes LTER: Fish Lengths and Weights 1981 - current
-   Time period
    -   Begin: 1981-07-28
    -   End: 2022-12-31
-   Abstract: This dataset consists of annual fish sampling conducted at multiple sites within the eleven primary lakes. Various sampling methods, such as seining, trapping, electrofishing, and gill netting, are used to capture fish and collect length, weight, and species information. The data are instrumental in tracking fish assemblages and understanding the dynamics of the lakes' ecosystems.

## Data and file overview

-   .gitignore: Used in Git version control to specify files and directories that should be ignored and not tracked by Git and exclude them from being staged or committed.

-   .Rdata: Used by the R programming language and is typically created when saving the workspace or specific objects in an R session

-   .Rhistory: A temporary file that is automatically updated as you work in the R console and records the history of commands entered in an R session.

-   data: Holds the data files or data sets, in this case the NTL LTER data file, that is used to generate the R project.

-   ENVS-193DS_homework-04_Toni-Jasmine.Rproj: This is the entire project and can be accessed from the folder on my computer to open up the project in R studio.

-   ES 193DS Homework 4.qmd: The quarto document with the code for the project on it. It incorporates the data to create working code.

-   README.md: This file is used to give an overview of this project and contains details about general information, accessibility, data, and other specifics.

## Data Availability and Access

-   The data for this project can be accessed through the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI) data portal. Detailed methodological information and specific data documentation can be found on the [relevant page](https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/968299a53784f9649eb67f421cc33340) within the EDI data portal.

## Methodological information

Fish sampling for the North Temperate Lakes LTER dataset follows a standardized methodology. Sampling occurs annually between the 3rd week of July and Labor Day, with specific sites chosen through a random process. Various fishing techniques, such as night seining, trammel netting, fyke netting, crayfish and minnow trapping, gill netting, and electrofishing are used to measure fish species. The collected data includes species identification, length measurements, weight samples, and additional information on fishing locations and equipment.
